                <h2>Ash, Incisive Instigator</h2>
                <h3>Born in the unforgiving Frontier, Dr. Ashleigh Reid - still very much a human - learned early that the only person who was going to look out for her was herself. One day, she was hired by a mercenary group for a delicate job: steal an experimental fuel source being researched in the Outlands city of Olympus. It was the perfect job for Reid, who infiltrated and psychologically manipulated the researchers for years. When the lab self-destructed, she died.</h3>

                <h2>Bloodhound, Technological Tracker</h2>
                <h3>Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen. The child of two engineers stationed at the New Dawn industrial plant on Talos, Bloodhound was taken in by their uncle Artur after a meltdown destroyed the facility and killed both their parents. Artur taught them the Old Ways, a belief system that focuses on the glory of nature and rejects modern technology. Yet Bloodhound was constantly drawn to technological marvels, and ultimately used both new and old methods to take down a Goliath that preyed on the people of their village, forever changing their life’s path.</h3>

                <h2>Caustic, Toxic Trapper</h2>
                <h3>Alexander Nox used to be one of the brightest scientists in the employ of Humbert Labs, the Frontier’s leading manufacturer of pesticide gases. Nox worked day and night developing new formulas for the glut of pesticides needed to protect the crops that sustained the Outlands. But he soon realized that progress was being hampered by his testing methods. He needed to test on more than just inert tissue: he needed living subjects.</h3>

                <h2>Loba, Translocating Life</h2>
                <h3>When Loba was nine, she looked on as simulacrum hitman Revenant killed her family. Left with nothing, Loba survived by picking pockets. As her skills improved, Loba used every tool at her disposal to lift herself from the gutter. Everything changed when she broke into a supposedly impenetrable facility and got her hands on the Jump Drive tech stored inside. With her new teleportation bracelet, the most secure and unattainable items were within her reach. So was her dream of living the high life.</h3>

                <h2>NewCastle, Heroic Defender</h2>
                <h3>Lamont Craig wasn’t like other dads in the neighborhood. Sure, he dropped the kids off at school and acted out multiple voices every night for Story Time with his toddler. But Lamont had secrets—the first being his real name, Jackson Williams. A top soldier for the IMC, Jackson went AWOL when he ignored direct orders to fight what he believed was a losing battle. He knew he would never be safe from the remnants of the IMC--and neither would his sister, Anita, as long as she was with him. So when he was presumed dead in a ship explosion, he used that opportunity to leave his life behind, even if it meant leaving her behind too.</h3>

                    <h2>Arena</h2>
                    <h3>Drop Off</h3>
                    <h4>One of the tallest buildings in Malta is the fully automated Hammond Manufacturing Tower, but its rooftop is left exposed due to its height and lack of human presence. Brought together by a mutual hatred for big Outland corporations, Arenas fighters covertly commandeer the place at night for fierce Arena matches under the smoggy skies. It’s a win-win for all groups involved, with an added element of danger for the participants and profits made on Hammond’s property right under their nose.</h4>
                    <h3>Habitat4</h2>
                    <h4>Storm Point is just one of many islands in the New Antillia archipelago. Habitat 4 is one of the smallest islands in the chain, and is best known as a Leviathan breeding ground. Early IMC research groups were surprised to find that a large population of local Leviathans gravitated toward the island, and designated Habitat 4 as an ethology base to study the creatures’ behavior. It’s been over a century since then, and while the IMC is gone, the gentle giants they studied here remain.</h4>
                    <h3>Encore</h3>
                    <h4>Found on the planet Boreas, Encore is the Arena where Seer made his name. Treated as a cursed outcast after being blamed for his planet’s moon being struck by a meteor, he slowly gathered a following of outsiders who would come to watch him compete. Over time, the Encore Arena became more and more designed to reflect the style of its star competitor.</h4>
                    <h3>Overflow</h3>
                    <h4>After trace amounts of Branthium were discovered in magma flows on Talos, Hammond Robotics began aggressively pursuing various means of mining it. One was an automated processing rig--officially referred to as Hephaestus Station, it’s affectionately referred to as Overflow. It hasn't seen any human activity for the majority of its operation, but after its spacious platforms caught the eyes of the Arenas organizers, it began doing double-duty as an industrial mining operation and a site for chaotic combat.</h4>
                    <h3>Party Crasher</h3>
                    <h4>While taking the Mirage Voyage on a joyride through the former IMC controlled hotspot Kómma on planet Solace, Mirage lost control of the ship and crashed it into a plaza. Any other person would have spent the rest of their life paying the bill for such a blunder, but since this once thriving city full of gambling, clubs, and home to various questionable activities has become a ghost town, Mirage, the Apex Legend he is, struck a deal with the current owners. With support of the upcoming Arenas matches, Mirage cleared his debt by assisting to reignite the city and put it back on the map.</h4>
                    <h3>Phase Runner</h3>
                    <h4>The Phase Runner on Olympus is unique, but it wasn’t the first of its kind: the Outlands scientific community had to test the technology before it was safe to install on Lilian Peck’s intellectual paradise. They built a research center in a remote section of Talos where they tested a truncated prototype of the Phase Runner. It has long since been abandoned, but the prototype remains intact and functional. Disagreements with ownership of the property has provided Arenas with the repeated opportunity to host matches without disruption.</h4>
                    <h3>Rotating Maps</h3>
                    <h4>As the underground bloodsport of the Outlands, Arenas knows how to host a match almost anywhere. In addition to bespoke locations, three bi-weekly rotating maps take place on points of interest across the Outlands. Test your skills on Artillery from Kings Canyon, Thermal Station from World’s Edge, Golden Gardens from Olympus and more!</h4>
       
                    <h2>Battle Royale</h2>
                    <h3>Grand Canyon</h3>
                    <h4>Once a simple settlement on the planet Solace, the island known as Kings Canyon didn't thrive until the IMC chose it as a hub for research and development. It housed an airbase, a water treatment plant, and a plethora of other facilities to support the IMC’s operations - like a highly classified project on the function of Phase tech, or a radical program to create a simulacra army powered by a single brain. But on the surface, Kings Canyon seemed like a simple IMC installation that, for all its faults, brought stability and jobs to Solace. To blow off steam, IMC soldiers stationed here would compete in gladiator-esque combat in an area they nicknamed 'Thunderdome'. Years later, when the Syndicate chose Kings Canyon as the site of their newest bloodsport, Thunderdome remained untouched - a tribute to the earliest known predecessor of the Apex Games. The island has undergone many changes since then - the Repulsor Tower was brought down by an unknown assailant, an underground explosion caused Thunderdome and Skulltown to collapse, and a ship crash obliterated the cliffs on the area’s northern edge. But no matter how it changes, it will always be the first home of the Apex Games.</h4>
                    <h3>World's Edge</h3>
                    <h4>A harsh planet beset by intense volcanic activity, Talos was once deemed uninhabitable, and only small luddite settlements took root there. However, it became a hotbed of IMC activity when a rare mineral compound was discovered beneath its surface. Heat-reducing towers were built to super-cool its natural lava flows and allow resource extraction - the facility that housed them was optimistically dubbed “New Dawn”, and the town of World’s Edge grew around it.</h4>
                    <h3>Olympus</h3>
                    <h4>Once a city built on dreams, Olympus was a utopia floating in clouds above Psamathe. Here, the brightest minds in the Outlands could gather and exchange ideas, leading to breakthroughs in the sciences and arts. However, an accident in an experimental research facility led to the creation of the Phase Rift (a massive bubble of Phase energy), and the Outlands’ best and brightest quickly abandoned the city. With the support of the Mercenary Syndicate, Hammond Robotics stepped in to transform Olympus into a new stage for the Apex Games. Since then, a ship from the Icarus Fleet brought a deadly virus along with powerful Medusa Vines to Olympus. While the virus was cured, the vines remained and kept the ship docked to the city. Additionally, a disastrous attempt to transport Olympus to a new location using phase technology sent the city into a tailspin, its structures being littered across the terrain as it stabilized. The changes shook up the Games, creating new challenges for participating Legends.</h4>
                    <h3>Storm Point</h3>
                    <h4>This deserted island wasn’t always so deserted. Beautiful and teeming with resources, Storm Point was the prime candidate for early IMC expeditions to planet Gaea. However, IMC settlement teams quickly discovered that intense tropical storms plague the island and a permanent settlement was established nearby–the city of Suotamo. As the city grew, the IMC built power-generating storm catchers on Storm Point to keep up with their energy needs. When the IMC pulled out of the Outlands, the storm catchers fell into disrepair. Left with only one functional storm catcher and few resources, the naive citizens of Storm Point decided to pull it down for parts. The absence of the storm catcher exacerbated the surrounding storms, causing them to overtake the island. Later, a survey of the area revealed previously unknown settlements but no survivors. The island was then abandoned for many years, save for the occasional scavenger or pirate, until it caught the eye of the Mercenary Syndicate. They knew there was old IMC tech and dangerous wildlife on Storm Point, but they didn’t realize how deadly the island was until the rumblings of a colossal sea beast woke the old IMC defenses. Now, Spectres roam fully-stocked IMC Armories, giving Apex Games competitors a new challenge.</h4>
